# CS360_Portfolio

Portfolio for CS360 Android Development -- SNHU
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
SimpleInventoryUI allows users to register, login, retrieve forgotten password via a stored phone number. Add new items, delete items, edit items, and exit the app. This allows a user to simply manage their database of items.

    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

User login screen, item display screen, register screen, forgotten password screen, and accounting for users wishing to easily modify each line item or delete them. Thus I incorporated easy increment/decrement functionality via a edit item popup and put a delete button next to each item.

    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

Starting from user requirements, I drew a layout and flowchart with the dataflow. Then began programming function by function and testing each function works with the rest of the code before continuing. The most challenging part was incorporating SQLite db into the workflow of Model View Architecture.

    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

By setting break points and stepping through code, I successfully managed to find erroneous object calls or broken data flow, and correct them before submission to production.

    Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Particularly, the SQL android development was new and challenging for me, so I had to dive into the documentation to implement the add user and item functionality.

    In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The main screen is a good use of screen real estate, and ease of use factor for the user (add button is in main bottom bar adheres to material design as well as rest of components on the app.
